# 👋 Hi, I’m Ahtesham  

💡 **CPU Architecture & FPGA Enthusiast**  
🔍 Passionate about exploring **pipeline design, hazard resolution, and RISC‑V architecture** — with a focus on learning, experimenting, and sharing insights.

---

## 🛠️ Interests & Focus
- Building and refining **multi‑cycle & pipelined CPU architectures**
- Exploring **forwarding, hazard handling, and control flow logic**
- Using FPGA synthesis tools to bring designs to life
- Visualizing architectures through **block diagrams & waveform analysis**
- Understanding the link between **assembly, machine code, and hardware behavior**

---

## 📂 Featured Learning Projects
### 🚀 [RISC‑V 32IM Pipeline CPU](#)
_A personal exploration of pipelining, hazards, and instruction handling_  
- Correct **PC tracking** for JAL, JALR, AUIPC, LUI, Branch  
- Hazard detection & forwarding paths validated with simulation  
- Synthesis tested on FPGA boards

### 🔍 [Pipeline Hazard Visualizer](#)
_A tool to visualize pipeline hazards and flush behavior in real time_  
- Simulates stall, flush, and forwarding scenarios  
- Built to deepen understanding of CPU control flow

---

## 📈 Current Goals
- Validate hazard handling under all branch/jump scenarios
- Expand regression testing for pipeline correctness
- Experiment with different FPGA boards & synthesis tools

---

## 📜 Enthusiast Philosophy
> “Curiosity fuels learning. Every bug is an opportunity to understand deeper.”

I believe in:
- **Hands‑on learning** — theory comes alive when tested in hardware
- **Documentation & visualization** — ideas are clearest when they can be shown
- **Community learning** — sharing progress to spark discussions
